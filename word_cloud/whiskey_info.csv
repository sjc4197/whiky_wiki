BuffaloTrace,Bourbon,USA,Kentucky,2,Sweet,NAS,45.0,"new, charred American oak","Produced anywhere in USA; Mash bill of at least 51% corn; aged in new, charred oak containers.","""Buffalo Trace Bourbon shows a medium intensity on the nose with light spice (particularly cinnamon), vanilla, caramel, apples, and a touch of leather. The bourbon is soft on the palate with a creamed corn taste profile and a gentle sweetness. The finish is tangy and offers a medium spice note. A great everyday dram."""
Lagavulin,PeatedSingleMalt,Scotland,Islay,3,Full Bodied & Peaty,16 Year,43.0,oak barrels,100% malted barley from a single distillery. Dried with peat.,"""Vegetarians need not be alarmed. Despite the meaty, brisket-y aroma to this whisky, cows were not harmed in its production. Peat smoke is integrated throughout the dram and that lavish mouthful of whisky that you are experiencing leads to the discovery of seaweed, fruit, and tobacco.  Hedonists, this one's for you."""
Blanton's,Bourbon,USA,Kentucky,2,Rich & Oily,NAS,46.5,New American Oak,"Produced anywhere in USA; Mash bill of at least 51% corn; aged in new, charred oak containers.","""Eventually, the initial nose of vanilla, caramel, and a hint of tobacco gives way to toffee, chocolate orange and leather on the tongue. The front of tongue burn and medium/long finish are accentuated by the thick and coating mouth-feel.  The complexity of this bourbon lives up to not only its packaging but is a fitting tribute to a true bourbon purist. It's perfect as a gift or an addition to any home bar. """
EagleRare,Bourbon,USA,Kentucky,2,Sweet & Full Bodied,10 Year,45.0,"new, charred American oak","Produced anywhere in USA; Mash bill of at least 51% corn; aged in new, charred oak containers.","""Eagle Rare 10 Year Bourbon is one of the great bourbon bargains out there, tasting way more expensive than it is. Its complexity starts with fruit flavors of dark cherries, red apples and bananas. Then the spices of cinnamon, clove and allspice kick in. These are rounded by honey, caramel, milk chocolate, vanilla and toasty oak. A rugged leather note rides it off into the sunset."""
Laphroaig,PeatedSingleMalt,Scotland,Islay,3,Peaty & Vanilla,10 Year,43.0,Ex-Bourbon,100% malted barley from a single distillery. Dried with peat.,"""Sticking your nose in a glass of this whisky instantly wakes up your senses.  Your mind races trying to pick out all of the aromas and tastes you're experiencing.  Peat Smoke? Check.  Band-aids? Seaweed? Check. Check. While you keep searching, you'll find even more goodies such as vanilla, toffee, and pears. Novice drinkers, fear not; belly up to the bar and order yourself a dram.  Life, as you know it, will never be quite the same."""
WoodfordReserve,Bourbon,USA,Kentucky,2,Full Bodied & Rich,NAS,45.2,"new, charred American oak","Produced anywhere in USA; Mash bill of at least 51% corn; aged in new, charred oak containers.","""Nose runs the gamut of vanilla, sweet corn, orange, and oak. Palate begins with strong notes of varnish, oak, alcohol heat, but gives way to charred orange, brown sugar and dried fruits. The finish is long and brings back the astringent notes on the nose."""
Maker'sMark,Bourbon,USA,Kentucky,2,Vanilla & Sweet,NAS,45.0,"new, charred American oak","Produced anywhere in USA; Mash bill of at least 51% corn; aged in new, charred oak containers.","""Vanilla bean and crème brûlée dominate a sweet nose, with a touch of spicy oak in the background. The palate is soft and sweet, with vanilla upfront, followed by a dose of spearmint, a just-opened loaf of whole wheat bread, and bitterness from Baker's chocolate and coffee grounds. The finish is short and vanilla-forward, rounded out by tannic oak towards the back.
"""
Bulleit,Bourbon,USA,Kentucky,2,Spicy,NAS,45.0,"new, charred American oak","Produced anywhere in USA; Mash bill of at least 51% corn; aged in new, charred oak containers.","""Nice nose with oak, still subtle hints of corn, vanilla and cinnamon. Taste is rye spice with burnt sugar, some tobacco and more rye. Medium finish where the cinnamon and rye in the mash bill come through again."""
FourRoses,Bourbon,USA,Kentucky,2,Spicy & Rich,NAS,50.0,"new, charred American oak","Produced anywhere in USA; Mash bill of at least 51% corn; aged in new, charred oak containers.","""The nose is full of cherries, pear, and chocolate along with some oak and toffee.  The palate finds even more oak, darker fruits, and an additional hint of chocolate. The long, easy finish comes back to the cherries, sugars, and oak.  """
BasilHayden,Bourbon,USA,Kentucky,2,Spicy,NAS,40.0,"new, charred American oak","Produced anywhere in USA; Mash bill of at least 51% corn; aged in new, charred oak containers.","""Nose is evident of a higher rye content, pepper, rye, honeysuckle. Palate is dry and easy with light notes of brown sugar, leather and rye. Smooth, quick finish with honey, and some warmth."""
Talisker,PeatedSingleMalt,Scotland,Islands,3,Peaty & Smoky,10 Year,45.8,ex-bourbon,100% malted barley from a single distillery. Dried with peat.,"""Bacon and kippers, iodine, and ripe pear were first to rise to the occasion. Salt & pepper are next up with sweet malty cereal replacing the fruit. The peat smoke is a bit late to the party, but eventually opens up on the 2nd tasting. The finish is dry which intensifies the peat."""
WoodfordReserve,Bourbon,USA,Kentucky,2,Sweet & Rich,NAS,45.2,"new charred oak, seasoned oak","Produced anywhere in USA; Mash bill of at least 51% corn; aged in new, charred oak containers.","""The classic Woodford flavors are there - bing cherry, pumpernickel, vanilla, caramel, leather and sweet spice. There's an additional sweet bread quality to this one (not pancreas, but cake, literally bread that is sweet) with some pleasant citrus, like a lemon poppy seed muffin. Very rich and complex. If anything, this tastes like classic Woodford, but more spruced up. In a good way."""
Weller,Bourbon,USA,Kentucky,2,Sweet & Fruity,NAS,45.0,"new, charred American oak","Produced anywhere in USA; Mash bill of at least 51% corn; aged in new, charred oak containers.","""Nose is nice and sweet with honey, apples, leather. Palate is delightful with well balanced sweet/semispicy, caramel apple, vanilla, and shelled nuts. Finish is a little long, crisp and continues with shelled nuts and honey."""
Ardbeg,PeatedSingleMalt,Scotland,Islay,3,Oily & Peaty,10 Year,46.0,None,100% malted barley from a single distillery. Dried with peat.,"""Just opening up the bottle, let alone pouring and taking a sip, you'll get a campfire aroma wafting in the air.  Cigar ash and medicinal camphor comes into play, but you will find other notes such as lemon zest, pears, and a smidgen of honey.  The whisky is oily and reminds you of smoked mackerel, but there is also a sweet spot of dark chocolate on the mid-palate.  All of this is to say, please, if you haven't already, dive head first into this dram. We live once.

MonkeyShoulder,BlendedMalt,Scotland,Speyside,2,Fruity & Sweet,NAS,40.0,Ex-bourbon,"Comprised of malted whisk(e)y from two or more distilleries; aged in barrels; if Scotch or Irish, must be aged for at least three years.","""Wakey wakey to a sunshine-y orange marmalade with a drizzling of honey on warm toast.  The mid-palate shows more malted barley than the nose with some added cinnamon sprinkled in mix.  More malt and herbs show up with continued tasting such as anise and mint.  The finish is of average length, but while it's around is quite dandy."""
Angel'sEnvy,Bourbon,USA,Kentucky,2,Fruity & Sweet,NAS,43.3,"new, charred American oak; finished in port","Produced anywhere in USA; Mash bill of at least 51% corn; aged in new, charred oak containers.","""Nose is full of vanilla and NYC street-cart sugar-roasted nuts. Caramel-covered raisins dipped in maple syrup and a hint of corn is found on the palate. The finish brings more raisins with bit of heat and sweet."""
ElijahCraig,Bourbon,USA,Kentucky,2,Sweet,NAS,47.0,"new, charred American oak","Produced anywhere in USA; Mash bill of at least 51% corn; aged in new, charred oak containers.","""The nose is full of caramel and fresh green herbs along with a fair amount of char smoke, apples, and toasted cereal flakes. The bourbon is soft and plush on your palate with a moderately sweet profile. It finishes with a tangy savory note and bit of leather and tobacco. An overall pleasant bourbon with a solid length to the finish for the price. Enjoyable as a daily go-to bourbon, and it's also a nice proof to enjoy on the rocks or in a cocktail."""
Glenfiddich,SingleMalt,Scotland,Speyside,2,Fruity & Vanilla,12 Year,40.0,"American oak ex-bourbon, European oak ex-sherry","Distilled in pot stills from 100% malted barley, produced at one distillery, aged in barrels; if Scotch or Irish, must be aged for at least three years.","""Aged predominately in used American whiskey barrels, the 12 year is aromatic with orchard fruits, butterscotch, and wood spices. There are tasting notes of oatmeal with cinnamon on the palate and though the finish is brief, it goes gentle into that good night. 
"""
Balvenie,SingleMalt,Scotland,Speyside,3,Fruity & Vanilla,12 Year,40.0,"traditional American oak barrels and hogsheads, Spanish oak ex-oloroso sherry","Distilled in pot stills from 100% malted barley, produced at one distillery, aged in barrels; if Scotch or Irish, must be aged for at least three years.","""Upon nosing this whisky, you'll get grapes and nuts with vanilla and honey to follow.  The whisky is slightly chewy in the middle and finishes with gentle wood spice and raisins.  It's a classic for a reason and a good measure of the entire collection Balvenie creates. 
"""
TheGlenlivet,SingleMalt,Scotland,Speyside,2,Vanilla & Fruity,12 Year,40.0,European and American oak,"Distilled in pot stills from 100% malted barley, produced at one distillery, aged in barrels; if Scotch or Irish, must be aged for at least three years.","""There are times that you want an über complex, confounding, whisky to consume.  And sometimes you just want a drink.  The Glenlivet has pleasant aromas of toasted cereal, pears, and honey.  The finish has more honey and vanilla but the whisky doesn't stay with you for the long haul.  And that's okay. """
